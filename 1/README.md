# Advent of Code 2021

Each day is in its own folder - `/1` for day 1, `/2` for day 2 etc.  

Each folder contains everything needed to complete the day eg `/1/1a.php` for day 1 part 1, `/1/1b.php` for day 1 part 2.

`index.php` at the root of the project is just for convenience and will just `include(...)` whatever solution.

Just uses PHP for now.  I may end up using some composer packages in the future if it makes my life a little easier.
